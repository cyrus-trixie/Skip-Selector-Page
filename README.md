 - Skip Selector Page
This is my redesigned "Choose Your Skip Size" page for the RemWaste coding challenge. I made it look fresh and work great on all devices, keeping the code clean and easy to understand.

What's Inside

o	Easy Sizes: Understand skip sizes with real-world examples (e.g., "fits ~40 bin bags").
o	Clear Details: Important features like "heavy waste" or "road permit" are easy to see with icons.
o	Help Guide: A section to help you pick the right skip if you're unsure.
o	Smart Selection: Clear visuals show you which skip you've picked.
o	Handy Bottom Bar: Always shows your selected skip and a "Continue to Book" button.
•	Works Everywhere: Looks good and works well on phones, tablets, and computers.
