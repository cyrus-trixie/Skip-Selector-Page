RemWaste - Skip Size Selector Page
This project is a new version of the "Choose Your Skip Size" page. I built it for a coding challenge from RemWaste. My main goals were to make it easy to use, look good on any device, and have clean, modern code.

What's New and Better
I worked on these main areas to make the page much better for users:

New Look:
Modern Style: The page has a clean, up-to-date design. It uses soft colors that are easy on the eyes and simple to read.
Clear Information: Each skip option shows details clearly, so it's easy to understand.
Better for Users:
Easy to Understand Sizes: Skip sizes are explained in simple ways (like "fits about 40 bin bags"). This helps you imagine how much trash it can hold.
Clear Features: Important details like if "heavy waste" is allowed or if a "road permit" is needed are shown with clear tags and pictures.
Help Guide: A section at the top gives advice if you're not sure which skip size to pick. It links to a guide for more help.
Easy Selection: When you pick a skip, it clearly shows that it's chosen.
Always-Visible Bar: A bar at the bottom stays on screen. It shows your chosen skip and has a clear "Continue to Book" button.
Works Everywhere: The page looks good and works well on phones, tablets, and computers of all sizes.
Clean Code:
Built with Parts: The page is made from small, reusable pieces of code (called components) using React. This makes it easy to manage.
Live Information: It gets skip information from an online source. If that source is down, it uses backup information so the page still works.
Loading and Error Messages: You'll see clear messages if the page is loading or if something goes wrong.
How to Run It Yourself
Follow these steps to get the project working on your computer:

Get the code:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/cyrus-trixie/Skip-Selector-Page.git
Go into the project folder:
Bash

cd Skip-Selector-Page
Install needed parts:
Bash

npm install
Start the project:
Bash

npm start
The page will open in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
What I Used
React: The main tool for building the page.
Tailwind CSS: Used for quickly styling the page.
Lucide React: For simple and clear icons.
JavaScript: The programming language used.
REST API: To get the skip information online.
Ideas for Next Steps
More Waste Details: Add a pop-up window that shows exactly what types of trash can go in each skip.
Skip Size Calculator: Make a tool that helps users figure out the best skip size based on how much trash they have.
Location Input: Let users type in their postcode to get skip options specific to their area.
Thank you for this challenge! I really enjoyed working on making the page user-friendly and responsive.
